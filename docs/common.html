<p>Key Certificates
&ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;&rdquo;
Key certificates were introduced in release 0.9.12.  Prior to that release, all
PublicKeys were 256-byte ElGamal keys, and all SigningPublicKeys were 128-byte
DSA-SHA1 keys.  A key certificate provides a mechanism to indicate the type of
the PublicKey and SigningPublicKey in the Destination or RouterIdentity, and to
package any key data in excess of the standard lengths.</p>

<p>By maintaining exactly 384 bytes before the certificate, and putting any excess
key data inside the certificate, we maintain compatibility for any software
that parses Destinations and Router Identities.</p>

<p>The key certificate payload contains:</p>

Destination or RouterIdentity are defined as the 256-byte ElGamal PublicKey
followed by the 128-byte DSA-SHA1 SigningPublicKey.  When a Key Certificate is
present, the preceeding 384 bytes are redefined as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Complete or first portion of Crypto Public Key</p></li>

<li><p>Random padding if the total lengths of the two keys are less than 384 bytes</p></li>

<li><p>Complete or first portion of Signing Public Key</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Crypto Public Key is aligned at the start and the Signing Public Key is
aligned at the end.  The padding (if any) is in the middle.  The lengths and
boundaries of the initial key data, the padding, and the excess key data
portions in the certificates are not explicitly specified, but are derived from
the lengths of the specified key types.  If the total lengths of the Crypto and
Signing Public Keys exceed 384 bytes, the remainder will be contained in the
Key Certificate.  If the Crypto Public Key length is not 256 bytes, the method
for determining the boundary between the two keys is to be specified in a
future revision of this document.</p>

type indicated:</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<pre><code>
* Implementers are cautioned to prohibit excess data in Key Certificates.
  The appropriate length for each certificate type should be enforced.

* A KEY certificate with types 0,0 (ElGamal,DSA_SHA1) is allowed but discouraged.
  It is not well-tested and may cause issues in some implementations.
  Use a NULL certificate in the canonical representation of a
  (ElGamal,DSA_SHA1) Destination or RouterIdentity, which will be 4 bytes shorter
  than using a KEY certificate.

Padding Generation Guidelines
`````````````````````````````````
These guidelines were proposed in Proposal 161 and implemented in API version 0.9.57.
These guidelines are backward-compatible with all versions since 0.6 (2005).
See Proposal 161 for background and further information.

For any currently-used combination of key types other than ElGamal + DSA-SHA1,
padding will be present. Additionally, for destinations, the 256-byte
public key field has been unused since version 0.6 (2005).

Implementers should generate the random data for
Destination public keys, and Destination and Router Identity padding,
so that it is compressible in various I2P protocols while
still being secure, and without having Base 64 representations appear to be corrupt or insecure.
This provides most of the benefits of removing the padding fields without any
disruptive protocol changes.

Strictly speaking, the 32-byte signing public key alone (in both Destinations and Router Identities)
and the 32-byte encryption public key (in Router Identities only) is a random number
that provides all the entropy necessary for the SHA-256 hashes of these structures
to be cryptographically strong and randomly distributed in the network database DHT.

However, out of an abundance of caution, we recommend a minimum of 32 bytes of random data
be used in the ElG public key field and padding. Additionally, if the fields were all zeros,
Base 64 destinations would contain long runs of AAAA characters, which may cause alarm
or confusion to users.

Repeat the 32 bytes of random data as necessary so the full KeysAndCert structure is highly compressible
in I2P protocols such as I2NP Database Store Message, Streaming SYN, SSU2 handshake, and repliable Datagrams.

Examples:

* A Router Identity with X25519 encryption type and Ed25519 signature type
  will contain 10 copies (320 bytes) of the random data, for a savings of approximately 288 bytes when compressed.

* A Destination with Ed25519 signature type
  will contain 11 copies (352 bytes) of the random data, for a savings of approximately 320 bytes when compressed.

Implementations must, of course, store the full 387+ byte structure because the SHA-256 hash of the structure
covers the full contents.



Notes
`````
* Do not assume that these are always 387 bytes! They are 387 bytes plus the
  certificate length specified at bytes 385-386, which may be non-zero.

* As of release 0.9.12, if the certificate is a Key Certificate, the boundaries
  of the key fields may vary. See the Key Certificate section above for
  details.

* The Crypto Public Key is aligned at the start and the Signing Public Key is
  aligned at the end. The padding (if any) is in the middle.

Notes
`````
* The public key of the destination was used for the old I2CP-to-I2CP
  encryption which was disabled in version 0.6, it is currently unused.

* The encryption key is used for end-to-end ElGamal/AES+SessionTag encryption
  [ELGAMAL-AES]_. It is currently generated anew at every router startup, it is
  not persistent.

* The signature may be verified using the signing public key of the
  destination.

* A LeaseSet with zero Leases is allowed but is unused.
  It was intended for LeaseSet revocation, which is unimplemented.
  All LeaseSet2 variants require at least one Lease.

* The signing_key is currently unused. It was intended for LeaseSet revocation,
  which is unimplemented. It is currently generated anew at every router
  startup, it is not persistent. The signing key type is always the same as the
  destination's signing key type.

* The earliest expiration of all the Leases is treated as the timestamp or
  version of the LeaseSet. Routers will generally not accept a store of a
  LeaseSet unless it is &quot;newer&quot; than the current one. Take care when publishing
  a new LeaseSet where the oldest Lease is the same as the oldest Lease in the
  previous LeaseSet. The publishing router should generally increment the
  expiration of the oldest Lease by at least 1 ms in that case.

* Prior to release 0.9.7, when included in a DatabaseStore Message sent by the
  originating router, the router set all the published leases' expirations to
  the same value, that of the earliest lease. As of release 0.9.7, the router
  publishes the actual lease expiration for each lease. This is an
  implementation detail and not part of the structures specification.

<li><p>Total size: 395 bytes minimum</p></li>

<li><p>Maximum actual expires time is about 660 (11 minutes) for
LeaseSet2_ and 65535 (the full 18.2 hours) for MetaLeaseSet_.</p></li>

<li><p>LeaseSet_ (1) did not have a &lsquo;published&rsquo; field, so versioning required
a search for the earliest lease. LeaseSet2 adds a &lsquo;published&rsquo; field
with a resolution of one second. Routers should rate-limit sending
new leasesets to floodfills to a rate much slower than once a second (per destination).
If this is not implemented, then the code must ensure that each new leaseset
has a &lsquo;published&rsquo; time at least one second later than the one before, or else
floodills will not store or flood the new leaseset.</p></li>

Encryption Key Preference
`````````````````````````

For published (server) leasesets, the encryption keys are in order of server preference,
most-preferred first. If clients support more than one encryption type, it is recommended
that they honor the server preference and select the first supported type as the
encryption method to use to connect to the server.
Generally, the newer (higher-numbered) key types are more secure or efficient and
are preferred, so the keys should be listed in reverse order of key type.

However, clients may, implementation-dependent, select based on their preference instead,
or use some method to determine the &quot;combined&quot; preference. This may be useful as
a configuration option, or for debugging.

The key order in unpublished (client) leasesets effectively does not matter, because
connections will usually not be attempted to unpublished clients.
Unless this order is used to determine a combined preference, as described above.


Options
```````
As of API 0.9.66, a standard format for service record options
is defined. See proposal 167 for details.
Options other than service records, using a different format,
may be defined in the future.

LS2 options MUST be sorted by key, so the signature is invariant.

Service record options are defined as follows:

- serviceoption := optionkey optionvalue
- optionkey := _service._proto
- service := The symbolic name of the desired service. Must be lower case. Example: &quot;smtp&quot;.
  Allowed chars are [a-z0-9-] and must not start or end with a '-'.
  Standard identifiers from [REGISTRY]_ or Linux /etc/services must be used if defined there.
- proto := The transport protocol of the desired service. Must be lower case, either &quot;tcp&quot; or &quot;udp&quot;.
  &quot;tcp&quot; means streaming and &quot;udp&quot; means repliable datagrams.
  Protocol indicators for raw datagrams and datagram2 may be defined later.
  Allowed chars are [a-z0-9-] and must not start or end with a '-'.
- optionvalue := self | srvrecord[,srvrecord]*
- self := &quot;0&quot; ttl port [appoptions]
- srvrecord := &quot;1&quot; ttl priority weight port target [appoptions]
- ttl := time to live, integer seconds. Positive integer. Example: &quot;86400&quot;.
  A minimum of 86400 (one day) is recommended, see Recommendations section below for details.
- priority := The priority of the target host, lower value means more preferred. Non-negative integer. Example: &quot;0&quot;
  Only useful if more than one record, but required even if just one record.
- weight := A relative weight for records with the same priority. Higher value means more chance of getting picked. Non-negative integer. Example: &quot;0&quot;
  Only useful if more than one record, but required even if just one record.
- port := The I2CP port on which the service is to be found. Non-negative integer. Example: &quot;25&quot;
  Port 0 is supported but not recommended.
- target := The hostname or b32 of the destination providing the service. A valid hostname as in [NAMING]_. Must be lower case.
  Example: &quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.b32.i2p&quot; or &quot;example.i2p&quot;.
  b32 is recommended unless the hostname is &quot;well known&quot;, i.e. in official or default address books.
- appoptions := arbitrary text specific to the application, must not contain &quot; &quot; or &quot;,&quot;. Encoding is UTF-8.

Examples:

In LS2 for aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.b32.i2p, pointing to one SMTP server:

&quot;_smtp._tcp&quot; &quot;1 86400 0 0 25 bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.b32.i2p&quot;

In LS2 for aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.b32.i2p, pointing to two SMTP servers:

&quot;_smtp._tcp&quot; &quot;1 86400 0 0 25 bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.b32.i2p,86400 1 0 25 cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc.b32.i2p&quot;

In LS2 for bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.b32.i2p, pointing to itself as a SMTP server:

&quot;_smtp._tcp&quot; &quot;0 999999 25&quot;


Notes
`````
* The public key of the destination was used for the old I2CP-to-I2CP
  encryption which was disabled in version 0.6, it is currently unused.

* The encryption keys are used for end-to-end ElGamal/AES+SessionTag encryption
  [ELGAMAL-AES]_ (type 0) or other end-to-end encryption schemes.
  See [ECIES]_ and proposals 145 and 156.
  They may be generated anew at every router startup
  or they may be persistent.
  X25519 (type 4, see [ECIES]_) is supported as of release 0.9.44.

* The signature is over the data above, PREPENDED with the single byte
  containing the DatabaseStore type (3).

* The signature may be verified using the signing public key of the
  destination, or the transient signing public key, if an offline signature
  is included in the leaseset2 header.

* The key length is provided for each key, so that floodfills and clients
  may parse the structure even if not all encryption types are known or supported.

* See note on the 'published' field in LeaseSet2Header_

* The options mapping, if the size is greater than one, must be sorted by key, so the signature is invariant.

protocol.

Contents
````````
1 byte Integer_ defining the relative cost of using the address, where 0 is
free and 255 is expensive, followed by the expiration Date_ after which the
address should not be used, or if null, the address never expires. After that
comes a String_ defining the transport protocol this router address uses.
Finally there is a Mapping_ containing all of the transport specific options
necessary to establish the connection, such as IP address, port number, email
address, URL, etc.

Notes
`````
* Cost is typically 5 or 6 for SSU, and 10 or 11 for NTCP.

* Expiration is currently unused, always null (all zeroes). As of release
  0.9.3, the expiration is assumed zero and not stored, so any non-zero
  expiration will fail in the RouterInfo signature verification. Implementing
  expiration (or another use for these bytes) will be a backwards-incompatible
  change. Routers MUST set this field to all zeros. As of release 0.9.12, a
  non-zero expiration field is again recognized, however we must wait several
  releases to use this field, until the vast majority of the network recognizes
  it.

* The following options, while not required, are standard and expected to be
  present in most router addresses: &quot;host&quot; (an IPv4 or IPv6 address or host
  name) and &quot;port&quot;.

<ul>

This is currently unused. It was intended for a form of restricted routes,
which is unimplemented.
Certain implementations may require the list to be sorted so the signature is invariant.
To be researched before enabling this feature.</p></li>

<li><p>The signature may be verified using the signing public key of the
router_ident.</p></li>

<li><p>See the network database page [NETDB-ROUTERINFO]_ for standard options that
are expected to be present in all router infos.</p></li>

<li><p>Very old routers required the addresses to be sorted by the SHA256 of their data
so the signature is invariant.
This is no longer required, and not worth implementing for backward compatibility.</p></li>
